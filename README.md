### Project Description
A Raspberry Pi 4 system that theatrically detects helmet violations‚Äîuselessly inspired by Kerala MVD‚Äôs AI cameras.  
> It loops dramatic ‚Çπ1000 fine messages when helmets aren‚Äôt ‚Äúweired,‚Äù and ignores humans if the light‚Äôs turned off.  
> A masterclass in performative surveillance: technically clever, socially pointless, gloriously absurd.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This Raspberry Pi 4‚Äìpowered system is a tribute to the art of performative enforcement, inspired by the theatrics of Kerala MVD‚Äôs AI camera saga. Armed with a webcam and a flair for drama, it scans for helmet violations and, upon detecting a bare head, unleashes a relentless loop of ‚Çπ1000 fine messages in bold red‚Äîno buzzer, no sound, just silent condemnation. The system proudly ignores humans if the light is turned off, embracing the absurd logic that visibility equals accountability. Technically competent yet socially pointless, it stands as a monument to surveillance without substance‚Äîa poetic protest wrapped in Python code.
